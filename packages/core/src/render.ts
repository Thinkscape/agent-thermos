## Codex Notes

Use Codex subagents or multi-agent tools when available. If the current Codex surface does not expose subagents, run the two passes sequentially in the main thread and keep the outputs clearly separated before synthesis.

# Thermos

Usage: \`${invocation} ${usageArgumentHint}\`

Run a double thermo review for the requested scope. If no scope is provided, review the current branch against \`main\`.

## Method

1. Determine the base ref, PR URL, or explicit file scope from \`$ARGUMENTS\`.
2. Gather \`git diff <base>...HEAD\`, changed-file paths, and enough file contents for reviewers to verify claims.
3. Launch both subagents in parallel:
   - \`${agentPrefix}thermo-nuclear-review-subagent\`
   - \`${agentPrefix}thermo-nuclear-code-quality-review-subagent\`
4. Pass both agents the same labeled context:
   - \`### Git / diff output\`
   - \`### Changed file contents\`
   - \`### User scope / intent\`
5. Synthesize with findings first, deduped across reviewers. Keep the summary brief.

If the plugin-scoped agents are unavailable, run the same two review passes with general-purpose subagents using the rubrics embedded in this command package.`;
