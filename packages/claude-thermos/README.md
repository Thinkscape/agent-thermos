Thermo-nuclear branch review for Claude Code: deep correctness and security
audits, strict maintainability rubrics, and parallel subagent orchestration.

Adapted from Cursor's MIT-licensed
[Thermos plugin](https://github.com/cursor/plugins/tree/main/thermos).

## Installation

Install the published Thermos plugin through Claude Code's plugin marketplace
flow:

```bash
claude plugin marketplace add Thinkscape/agent-thermos
claude plugin install thermos@agent-thermos
```

Inside an interactive Claude Code session, the equivalent slash commands are:

```text
/plugin marketplace add Thinkscape/agent-thermos
/plugin install thermos@agent-thermos
```

The Claude marketplace entry is
[`/.claude-plugin/marketplace.json`](../../.claude-plugin/marketplace.json) and
installs the published npm package
[`@thinkscape/claude-thermos`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@thinkscape/claude-thermos).
The plugin manifest is named `thermos` so commands stay short.

## Primary invocation

```text
/thermos:run [base-ref | PR URL | scope]
```

For an unprefixed command, install the optional standalone shim:

```bash
npm install -g @thinkscape/claude-thermos
claude-thermos install-command --scope project
```

Then use:

```text
/thermos [base-ref | PR URL | scope]
```

## Agents

| Agent | Description |
|:------|:------------|
| `thermos:thermo-nuclear-review-subagent` | Deep diff-scoped review for correctness, security, devex, and feature-gate risk. |
| `thermos:thermo-nuclear-code-quality-review-subagent` | Strict code-quality review for structure, code-judo, 1k-line rule, and boundaries. |

## Typical usage

```text
/thermos:run main
/thermos:run https://github.com/acme/app/pull/123
/thermos:run review the API changes only
```

Thermos gathers diff context, launches both agents with the same input, and
synthesizes prioritized findings. Use the optional `/thermos` shim if you prefer
the shorter local command.
